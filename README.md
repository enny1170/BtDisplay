# BtDisplay
ESP32 Based Display Unit usef for Displaying BG.

Currently the solution uses the http webserver from xdrip.
The Solution is still under development and the WiFi connection and the xdrip url are hardcoded.
Maye a later solution will be configurable.
Then it also will be possible to use https and nightscout.

This Code is for the esp32 Wifi kit from heltec.cn.
Heltec esp32 WiFi kit has the display on board.
Using this code with other displays, the display connection must be changed.
